An accessibility value helps users of assistive technologies to understand the value of elements on the screen. A slider should indicate the currently selected value, and ideally also it's minimum and maximum value. The screen reader announces the value of elements as it reads the screen. It is important to assign correct values to elements to avoid misunderstanding.
