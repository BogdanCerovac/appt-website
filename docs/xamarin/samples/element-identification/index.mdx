Functionality that is repeated on multiple screens should use consistent identification. Screen readers users rely heavily on their familiarity with functions that may appear on different screens. If identical functions have different labels on different screens, your app will be considerably more difficult to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive limitations.
