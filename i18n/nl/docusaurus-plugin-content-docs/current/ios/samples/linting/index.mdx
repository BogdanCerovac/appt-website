Linting is the process of running a tool which analyzes your code for potential errors. Generally, each problem detected by the tool is reported with a description message and a severity level. This allows you to quickly prioritize the critical improvements that need to be made. Everyone benefits from higher code quality, plus it improves the accuracy of assistive technologies.
