# Identify Input Purpose

Ensure it is clear what information is expected from users inside input fields. Set the correct input type to allow auto-completion, e.g. for e-mail addresses. This is faster for everyone and reduces errors for users with disabilities.

## Impact

- Give clear instructions and ensure that fields can be filled in automatically by assistive technologies.
- Clear instructions are very important for people with cognitive disabilities.
- For people with a motor disability, filling in forms automatically is a lot easier.
- Clear instructions and auto-completion makes it easier for everyone to fill in information.

## Check

“*Is the purpose of the input field made clear?*“

This can be tested visually, no assistive technologies are needed.

## Solution

### Set content type

<CodeSample id="input-content-type" locale="en"/>

### Set keyboard type

<CodeSample id="input-keyboard-type" locale="en"/>
