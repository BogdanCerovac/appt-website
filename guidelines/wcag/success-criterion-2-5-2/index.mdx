# Pointer Cancellation

Ensure it is possible to cancel touches. Buttons should only activate by clicking and not by touching. This gives the user the option to cancel the activation.

## Check

“*Is it possible to cancel touches, to avoid click events?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.
