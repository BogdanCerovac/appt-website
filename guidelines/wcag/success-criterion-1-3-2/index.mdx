# Meaningful Sequence

Ensure that the order which assistive technologies follow accurately reflects the meaning of the content. Elements that belong together must be presented together. Otherwise, users may misunderstand the content.

## Impact

The content should be presented to assistive technologies in a meaningful way. This  allows users of voice control, keyboard control, switch control and the screen reader to present the content a meaningful way.

## Check

“*Is the order of elements clear for users of assistive technologies?”*

You can use a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) of [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access) to check the order of elements.

## Solution

### Set accessibility order
