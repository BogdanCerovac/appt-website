# Enough Time

Users must be able to complete tasks in the time they require. Users with disabilities or those who use assistive technologies often need more time to complete tasks. Filling in data takes much longer when using switch control. People who are visually impaired need more time to read. It should therefore be possible to extend time limits and pause distracting content.
