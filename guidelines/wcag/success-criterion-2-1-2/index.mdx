# No Keyboard Trap

Ensure users of the keyboard interface do not get stuck. Users might not be able to close pop-ups, menus and overlays. Many assistive technologies do not support clicking next to an element. You must include a close button which assistive technologies can activate.

## Impact

- Users get very frustrated when they get stuck while using an app.
- For example, in processes, prevent users from getting stuck by repeating actions indefinitely.

## Check

*“Are there places in the app where you get stuck with assistive technologies?“*

We suggest testing with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) and [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access).

## Solution

Add a close button to all overlay and popups.

### Add close button
