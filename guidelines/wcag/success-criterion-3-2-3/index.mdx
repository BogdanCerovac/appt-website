# Consistent Navigation

Ensure navigation is always in the same place. For example, place the back button in the top left corner. Consistent navigation is especially useful for users of assistive technologies.

## Impact

Anyone can use an app more easily when repeating content is structured in the same way. Especially people with cognitive, intellectual or visual impairments benefit from this.

## Check

“*Is the way of navigation the same on each screen?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) and [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508).

## Solution

### Use consistent positioning
