# Consistent Identification

Ensure icons always have the same function. For example, only use a magnifying glass icon to search, and not to enlarge. This makes it clear to users which function they can expect from this icon.

## Impact

- Consistent use of icons makes it easier for everyone to learn what function each icon has
- People with learning disabilities can use the app more easily if icons are used in the same ways.

## Check

*“Do icons have the same function everywhere?”*

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) and [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508).
