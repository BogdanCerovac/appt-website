# Focus Visible

Ensure that elements focused by assistive technologies are clearly indicated. App developers might not be able to adjust the color of the frame. However, it is possible to give elements a different background color when they have focus.

## Impact

- Apps become more usable when the element with focus is clearly visible.

## Check

“*Is the focus clearly shown everywhere when navigating with assistive technologies?*“

This can be tested with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) or [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access).

Note: apps cannot adjust the color of the focus frame. This can only be done by the user through the system settings.

### Solution

### Add accessibility focus indicator
