        The Appt Foundation is working towards a world where everyone can use apps equally. To make this vision a reality, we have written a handbook. It helps you learn the basics of app accessibility in a straightforward way.

        On June 23, 2021, we published the first edition of the handbook. This version has been distributed 1,500 times on paper and thousands of times digitally.

        On May 16, 2024, we published the second edition of the handbook. The content has been improved, and we have added guidance for the new Success Criteria introduced in WCAG 2.2.
